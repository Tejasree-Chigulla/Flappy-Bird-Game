# Flappy-Bird-Game
This project is a Python-based Flappy Bird game built using the Pygame library. It features smooth animations, sound effects, pixel-perfect collision detection, and gameplay inspired by the classic Flappy Bird. An advanced version uses NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) to train AI to play the game autonomously.
